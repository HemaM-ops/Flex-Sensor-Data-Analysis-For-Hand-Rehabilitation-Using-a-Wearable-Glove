# Flex-Sensor-Data-Analysis-For-Hand-Rehabilitation-Using-a-Wearable-Glove
The research analyzed flex sensor data and proposed a wearable device integrating flex sensor technology to enhance rehabilitation. It provides real-time insights from finger movements, aiding patient recovery. By categorizing improvement into Normal, Mild, and Severe Impairment, it improves the rehabilitation process.

File 1 : 1_Each_Finger.py

A python script that collects the sensor data from the user wearing the glove.

File 2: 2_noise.py

Handles and removes the noise in the collected sensor data.

File 3: 3_abs_classification

Classifies the categories of the finger movements done by the user.
